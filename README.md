# Notes from the Author
The software code uses standard sensors libraries and code widely available on the Internet. You can find the full list of used sensors and libraries in the document Bulun Skunk Works - UlisseHPC.pdf. Nevertheless the software UlisseHPC_v1.0.py to steer the robot is entirely custom-built, thus its porting will require a variable degree of adaptation to your specific case, e.g. adjustments of Pin numbers, add/change/removal of sensor's libraries, change of the Master/Worker HPC Framework.

# Prerequisites
Other than the sensors-specific libraries, the main preprequisites are:
- Python 2.7
- OpenCV 4.2
- MPI4PI 3.0.3
